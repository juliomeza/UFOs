# UFOs

## Overview of Project
Create an interactive website that allows readers to parse data around USO sightings.

## Results
People can use one or all five filters to parse data. For example, in the screenshot below, the data is filtered only by shape 'triangle'

In this second graph the data is filtered by date '1/11/2010' and shape 'triangle'

And in this last one I have used all 5 boxes to filter data by date, city, state, country and shape.

Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

## Summary
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
