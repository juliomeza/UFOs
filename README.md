# UFOs

## Overview of Project
Create an interactive website that allows readers to parse data around USO sightings.

## Results
People can use one or all five filters to parse data. For example, in the screenshot below, the data is filtered only by shape 'triangle'

In this second graph the data is filtered by date '1/11/2010' and shape 'triangle'

And in this last one I have used all 5 boxes to filter data by date, city, state, country and shape.

## Summary
- One drawback is that the font color inside the filter boxes gives you the impression that the data is being filtered already.
Recommendations:
1. Move the filter search box to the top of the columns instead of the side of the page.
2. Apply the filtering while typing instead of waiting for the 'Enter' key.
